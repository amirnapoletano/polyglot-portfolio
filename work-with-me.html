              One sharp, modern landing page for your product or service. Structure, copy guidance, and UI designed

              Taking a Figma file or a rough idea and turning it into a live, responsive front-end. Clean HTML,
              modern CSS, animations, and structure that can plug into your existing tech stack or a framework
              like SvelteKit.

          I like to keep things simple, transparent, and structured. A typical project goes through four stages:

        <div class="cards-grid">
          <article class="about-block">
            <h3>1. Discovery</h3>
            <p>
              We clarify your product, audience, goals, and constraints. This can be a short call or async via
              email/chat if you prefer writing.

          <article class="about-block">
            <h3>2. Direction</h3>
            <p>
              I define a visual direction and layout approach: typography, colors, spacing, and first key sections
              so you see the tone before we go deeper.
            </p>

          <article class="about-block">
            <h3>3. Design &amp; build</h3>
            <p>
              I design the full layout and implement it as a responsive front-end. You’ll see progress in clear
              checkpoints and can give feedback along the way.

            <h3>4. Delivery &amp; support</h3>
            <p>
              You receive final files and code, plus a short support window for small adjustments after launch.
